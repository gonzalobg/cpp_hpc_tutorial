    "\n",
    "If [Lab 1: DAXPY](../lab1_daxpy/daxpy.ipynb) was quick to complete for you, Lab 1 proposes a slightly more advanced example which requires the decomposition of a problem into multiple algorithm calls. You will use different approaches, sequential and parallel, to write a function `select` which selects some elements of an input vector `v` according to a general, user-provided criterion and copies the selected element consecutively into a new vector `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is easy to solve sequentially but faces an issue in a concurrent run: the index of write operations into `w` depends on operations performed by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the exercises, the vector `v` is filled with pseudo-random numbers that are seeded with a constant value and are therefore identical from one execution to another.\n",

    "## Exercise 1: serial implementation with `std::copy_if`\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this first exercise is to write a version of `select` which calls the algorithm `copy_if`. It is simple an elegant, but not parallelizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A template for the solution is provided in [exercise1.cpp]. The `TODO` indicates the part of the template that must be completed.\n",
    "A first version of `select` is provided, which looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",

    "std::vector<int> select(const std::vector<int>& v, UnaryPredicate pred)\n",

    "    // call to copy all elements from v to w that are selected by the unary predicate.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "[exercise1.cpp]: ./exercise1.cpp\n",

    "The example compiles and runs as provided, but it produces incorrect results due to the erroneous `select` implementation.\n",
    "Replace the erroneous line by an appropriate call to the `copy_if` algorithm.\n",
    "Hint: You can't allocate the right number of elements for `w` in advance, because you don't know how many elements the `copy_if` algorithm is going to copy. Instead, use `std::back_inserter` to create an iterator which inserts elements at the back of `w` and resizes the vector appropriately as the algorithm progresses.\n",
