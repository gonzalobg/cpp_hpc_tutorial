    "\n",
    "If Lab 0 (DAXPY) was quick to complete for you, Lab 1 proposes a slightly more advanced example which requires the decomposition of a problem into multiple algorithm calls. You will use different approaches, sequential and parallel, to write a function `select` which selects some elements of an input vector `v` according to a general, user-provided criterion and copies the selected element consecutively into a new vector `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is easy to solve sequentially but faces an issue in a concurrent run: the index of write operations into `w` depends on operations performed by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the exercises, the vector `v` is filled with pseudo-random numbers that are seeded with a constant value and are therefore identical from one execution to another.\n",

    "The goal of this first exercise is to write a version of `select` which calls the algorithm `copy_if`. It is simple an elegant, but not parallelizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A template for the solution is provided in [exercise0.cpp]. The `TODO` indicates the part of the template that must be completed.\n",
    "A first version of `select` is provided, which looks as follows:\n",

    "Replace the erroneous line by an appropriate call to the `copy_if` algorithm.\n",
    "Hint: You can't allocate the right number of elements for `w` in advance, because you don't know how many elements the `copy_if` algorithm is going to copy. Instead, use `std::back_inserter` to create an iterator which inserts elements at the back of `w` and resizes the vector appropriately as the algorithm progresses.\n",
