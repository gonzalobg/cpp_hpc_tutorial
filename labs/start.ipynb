    "This half-day hands-on tutorial teaches how to accelerate portable HPC applications with CPUs and GPUs using the parallelism and concurrency features of the C++17 and C++20 standards. Attendees will accelerate a canonical PDE solver for the unsteady heat equation from a single threaded implementation to a multi-CPU/multi-GPU implementation that overlaps computation with communication. Along the way, they will learn about C++ concurrency features like threads, atomics, barriers, and parallel algorithms. The tutorial teaches how to integrate these features into hybrid HPC applications using MPI. Finally, we conclude with an outlook of C++2x features that simplify overlapping communication and computation, and a summary of our experience applying ISO C++ as the programming model to accelerate large real-world HPC applications.\n",
